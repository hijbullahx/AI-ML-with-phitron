        "Description\n",
        "This project simulates a simple AI-based vehicle classifier using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
        "It demonstrates inheritance, protected and private members, method overriding, and encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The program manages two types of vehicles: Car and Bike. Each class inherits from a base class Vehicle.\n",
        "A simple classifier method predicts the type of vehicle based on its speed threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Task Statement\n",
        "Design and implement a simple program that classifies vehicles based on their type and speed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "You must:\n",
        "Create a base class Vehicle that stores vehicle type, name, and speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Use protected and private attributes in the base class to demonstrate encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Implement a method classify() that categorizes vehicles as High-speed Vehicle if the speed is greater than 100, otherwise Normal Vehicle.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Derive two subclasses — Car and Bike — from Vehicle. Each should override the show_info() method to display detailed information.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Read multiple inputs representing different vehicles, create corresponding objects, and print their details along with their classification results.\n",
