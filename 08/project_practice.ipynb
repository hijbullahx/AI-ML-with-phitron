    "## Project Name:  Smart Vehicle Classifier\n",
    "Description\n",
    "This project simulates a simple AI-based vehicle classifier using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "It demonstrates inheritance, protected and private members, method overriding, and encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program manages two types of vehicles: Car and Bike. Each class inherits from a base class Vehicle.\n",
    "A simple classifier method predicts the type of vehicle based on its speed threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Task Statement\n",
    "Design and implement a simple program that classifies vehicles based on their type and speed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must:\n",
    "Create a base class Vehicle that stores vehicle type, name, and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use protected and private attributes in the base class to demonstrate encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a method classify() that categorizes vehicles as High-speed Vehicle if the speed is greater than 100, otherwise Normal Vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Derive two subclasses — Car and Bike — from Vehicle. Each should override the show_info() method to display detailed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Read multiple inputs representing different vehicles, create corresponding objects, and print their details along with their classification results.\n",

    "Type: Car, Name: Toyota, Speed: 150 km/h, Predicted: High-speed Vehicle\n",
    "Type: Bike, Name: Yamaha, Speed: 90 km/h, Predicted: Normal Vehicle\n",
    "Type: Car, Name: Honda, Speed: 120 km/h, Predicted: High-speed Vehicle\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Short Hint\n",
    "Use a base class Vehicle with protected and private attributes.\n",
    "Create subclasses Car and Bike that override show_info() and add a simple speed-based classifier.\n",
    "Speed above 100 is considered a \"High-speed Vehicle\".\n",
